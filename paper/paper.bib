	abstract = {We present a probabilistic topic-based model for content similarity called pmra that underlies the related article search feature in PubMed. Whether or not a document is about a particular topic is computed from term frequencies, modeled as Poisson distributions. Unlike previous probabilistic retrieval models, we do not attempt to estimate relevance–but rather our focus is "relatedness", the probability that a user would want to examine a particular document given known interest in another. We also describe a novel technique for estimating parameters that does not require human relevance judgments; instead, the process is based on the existence of MeSH ® in MEDLINE ®.},

    abstract = "{Document recommendation systems for locating relevant literature have mostly relied on methods developed a decade ago. This is largely due to the lack of a large offline gold-standard benchmark of relevant documents that cover a variety of research fields such that newly developed literature search techniques can be compared, improved and translated into practice. To overcome this bottleneck, we have established the RElevant LIterature SearcH consortium consisting of more than 1500 scientists from 84 countries, who have collectively annotated the relevance of over 180 000 PubMed-listed articles with regard to their respective seed (input) article/s. The majority of annotations were contributed by highly experienced, original authors of the seed articles. The collected data cover 76\\% of all unique PubMed Medical Subject Headings descriptors. No systematic biases were observed across different experience levels, research fields or time spent on annotations. More importantly, annotations of the same document pairs contributed by different scientists were highly concordant. We further show that the three representative baseline methods used to generate recommended articles for evaluation (Okapi Best Matching 25, Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency and PubMed Related Articles) had similar overall performances. Additionally, we found that these methods each tend to produce distinct collections of recommended articles, suggesting that a hybrid method may be required to completely capture all relevant articles. The established database server located at https://relishdb.ict.griffith.edu.au is freely available for the downloading of annotation data and the blind testing of new methods. We expect that this benchmark will be useful for stimulating the development of new powerful techniques for title and title/abstract-based search engines for relevant articles in biomedical research.}",

	abstract = {Motivation: Text-mining (TM) solutions are developing into efficient services to researchers in the biomedical research community. Such solutions have to scale with the growing number and size of resources (e.g. available controlled vocabularies), with the amount of literature to be processed (e.g. about 17 million documents in PubMed) and with the demands of the user community (e.g. different methods for fact extraction). These demands motivated the development of a server-based solution for literature analysis.Whatizit is a suite of modules that analyse text for contained information, e.g. any scientific publication or Medline abstracts. Special modules identify terms and then link them to the corresponding entries in bioinformatics databases such as UniProtKb/Swiss-Prot data entries and gene ontology concepts. Other modules identify a set of selected annotation types like the set produced by the EBIMed analysis pipeline for proteins. In the case of Medline abstracts, Whatizit offers access to EBI's in-house installation via PMID or term query. For large quantities of the user's own text, the server can be operated in a streaming mode (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/webservices/whatizit).Contact: rebholz@ebi.ac.uk},
